Welcome to the jungle
We got fun and games
We got everything you want
Honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got no money, honey
We got your disease
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
Oh, I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed
But that's the price you pay
You're a very sexy girl
Very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get them for free
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream
Welcome to the jungle
It's worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal
In the jungle where we play
You got a hunger for what you see
